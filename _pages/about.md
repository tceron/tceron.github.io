Hi, nice that you passed by. =) 

My primary focus in research lies in modeling societal discourse. This involves tasks such as developing methods to mine ideologies, and more generally, opinions from textual data. Iâ€™m also interested in understanding the underlying biases embedded in large language models (LLMs) and how they manifest in downstream tasks. Lastly, I enjoy thinking about the implementation of my research in real world use case applications, such as news recommenders.
