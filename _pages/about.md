Hi, nice that you passed by. =) 

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [MilaNLP](https://milanlproc.github.io) group at [Bocconi University](https:\\www.bocconi.it/). My research lies in understanding how algorithms, and more specifically language models filter information such as understanding the types of biases embedded in large language models (LLMs) and how they manifest in downstream tasks. I am also keen on developing methods for modeling societal discourse. This involves tasks such as developing methods to mine ideologies, and more generally, opinions from texts. Lastly, I enjoy thinking about the implementation of my research in real world use case applications, such as news recommenders. Speaking of which, I am co-leading the project [MULTIVIEW](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/projects/multiview/) which investigates methods for diversifying news recommendations in terms of perspectives.
