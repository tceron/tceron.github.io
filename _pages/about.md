My primary focus in research lies in the realm of computational social sciences, particularly delving into modeling societal discourse. This involves tasks like identifying ideologies contained and extracting opinions from textual data. Moreover, I'm interested in understanding the underlying worldviews embedded in large language models (LLMs) and what effect they may have in downstream tasks. Lastly, I enjoy thinking about the implementation of my research in real world use cases applications, such as news recommenders.
