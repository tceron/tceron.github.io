# PERSONAE

During my postdoc at Bocconi University, I work in the ERC project [PERSONAE](https://www.deboranozza.com/project/personae/) led by [Debora Nozza](https://www.deboranozza.com). I'm currently investigating biases present in the data and the role of LLMs in the information environment.

# MULTIVIEW

Recommendation algorithms have a profound impact on democracies: They can **boost or hinder** the interaction of citizens with several opinions and viewpoints. In this project we develop methods to reshape news recommendation. Using AI, we **automatically identify perspectives** in news articles and develop a recommender that provides a wide view of perspectives to users. This allows, for example, news consumers to have a broader understanding of events or current affairs in the world. 

Funded by MINT-INNOVATION 2024 and Software Campus 2023 (in collaboration with Springer Nature and Die Zeit).

# MARDY: Modeling ARgumentation DYnamics in Political Discourse

I've worked in the MARDY project throughout my PhD. MARDY is a interdisciplinary collaboration, combining Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, and Political Science, aims to create innovative computational models and techniques for examining argumentation in political discourse. This involves tracking the evolution of discursive exchanges on contentious topics over time. The objective is to develop tools that assist in analyzing the potential influence of arguments presented by various political actors.
